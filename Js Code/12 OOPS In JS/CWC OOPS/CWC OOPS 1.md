## 4 Pillars of OOPS
 - Abstraction = Hiding the complexity and showing only the essentials

- Encapsulation = Binding the data and the functions that manipulate the data together

- Inheritance = Eliminates redundant code and extends the use of existing code

- Polymorphism = Many forms



# Constructor function

   - S1 as soon as you enter a new keyword empty object will be created = also called as instance
   - S2 Due to new keyword constructor function will be called all the arguments will be pack inside the constructor function
