Hum Kisi Bhi function ko aysnc bana sakte hai aur uske andar Promise Ko await kar sakte hai

Async function always return the promise

Async = It is used to define an asynchronous function. It returns a promise. It can contain await expressions.

Await = It is used to wait for the promise to resolve or reject. It can only be used inside an async function.

Async/await is a powerful feature in JavaScript that simplifies asynchronous programming and makes it appear more like synchronous code. It is built on top of Promises and provides a more intuitive and readable way to write asynchronous code.

    Async/await:
        Async functions: Special type of function that allows the use of await inside.
        Defined using the async keyword before function declaration or expression.
        Implicitly returns a Promise that resolves to the function's return value or rejects with an error.

    Await keyword:
        Used inside async functions to pause execution until a Promise settles.
        Function waits for Promise resolution and resumes execution, returning the resolved value.
        Can only be used with Promises or thenable objects (with a then method).

    Error handling:
        Use try/catch blocks to handle errors within async functions.
        If a Promise is rejected, an error is thrown and can be caught with a catch block.
