What is CLOSURES in javascript ?
        Ans = CLOSURE IS FUNCTION ALONG WITH ITS LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT

 A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
Closures = function toh return karega hi uske sath woh uska lexical environment bhi return karega



CLOSURE EXAMPLE FOR THE INTERVIEWING


  function init() {
      var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
      function displayName() {
          // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
          console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
      }
      name = "Akshaya"
      displayName(); //
  }
  let c = init();
  // Akshaya Why ? = Because the closure (displayName) is called after the variable is changed = closure
  // returns the latest value of the variable
