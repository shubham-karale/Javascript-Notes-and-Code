/*
 Why  1 and 2 are false but the 3rd statement are true?
  Ans = Reason is that null is a special value in JavaScript that represents nothingness.
     and it's nature when we use comparison operator it will convert null to 0.
     when we use equality operator it will not convert null to 0.

console.log(null > 0); //op = false
console.log(null == 0); // op = false
console.log(null >= 0); // op = true
