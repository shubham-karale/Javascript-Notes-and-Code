//All About Date

Date and time in JavaScript are represented with the Date object. We can’t create “only date” or “only time”: Date objects always carry both.
Months are counted from zero (yes, January is a zero month).
Days of week in getDay() are also counted from zero (that’s Sunday).
Date auto-corrects itself when out-of-range components are set. Good for adding/subtracting days/months/hours.
Dates can be subtracted, giving their difference in milliseconds. That’s because a Date becomes the timestamp when converted to a number.
Use Date.now() to get the current timestamp fast.
